    <p>What's up evil, creative masterminds of the digital design and development arena? What have you been crafting today? Much? Nothing? In any case, if you have 180 seconds to waste anyway, I just wanted to share a little list of features that I've come to like about Adobe's "comp-to-code" web application called "Project Parfait".</p>

<p>Yep, pop in that PSD and get some nifty information needed for turning that static file into something magic. Pretty simple, but it's nice to see some software that seamlessly accepts a PSD without being a pain in the ass. So without any further ado, here's the top 4 features I like about Project Parfait:</p>

<h2 id="1typographicoverviews">1. Typographic Overviews</h2>

<p>That's right, after uploading the PSD, you can click on text anywhere in the document and see its font family (if on TypeKit), weights and what sizes are being used where. A very nice feature in itself, but what I didn't expect is the ability to switch between different font units. I usually develop in <code>rem</code>, so being able to switch to that unit is really handy (for me, at least).</p>

<h2 id="2elementdistancecalculations">2. Element Distance Calculations</h2>

<p>Project Parfait supports clicking and then shift-clicking on two elements which will give you the x and y distance (in pixels only, it seems) between the two. I've received several PSDs from a graphic designer and sometimes ended up pixel pushing things until it looked right visually, only to eventually jump into the PSD and manually using the ruler tool to calculate the distance. No need for that anymore!</p>

<h2 id="3colorpaletteextraction">3. Color Palette Extraction (!)</h2>

<p>It might seem like a banality, but if I had a dollar for every time I had to either a.) extract a color palette manually because no one supplied me with any web-friendly values or b.) email clients or associated designers for those values I'd finally be able to get that ruby-covered gold scepter I've always wanted... Project Parfait allows you to quickly extract those values and have them ready-at-hand. I like that.</p>

<h2 id="4csscodepreview">4. CSS Code Preview</h2>

<p>This is a no-brainer, but incredibly helpful; click on an element and you will get a (well-)generated CSS code for that element in a previewer window. I know it's simple, but ignoring the width and height code, it makes it very easy to just click, copy and paste into your stylesheet. My only concern is how this fits a workflow involving pre-processors such as Sass or Less. It could be interesting to see if Project Parfait could understand a specific naming convention of a PSDs folder structure that would then translate into neatly organized components... or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Aight, everything must come to an end, <a href="https://projectparfait.adobe.com/">Project Parfait</a> has more features to offer, and you should give it a little checkout when you get the time. I'll definitely try giving it a spin into my workflow.</p>

<p>Keep awesome!</p>
